# GRC Portfolio

Welcome to my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) learning portfolio.  
I am a non-traditional student pivoting into cybersecurity, focused on building the habits and skills of a future GRC analyst.  

This repository documents my weekly practice with:  
- CVE analysis through the lens of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
- Risk register entries with likelihood, impact, and mitigation plans  
- Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&Ms) that connect technical issues to business risk  
- References to official advisories, NVD entries, and frameworks  

Each **week** contains a fully worked example of:  
1. A real-world vulnerability (CVE)  
2. Mapped to NIST CSF functions and subcategories  
3. Documented as if I were supporting a compliance team  

My goal: To master the fundamentals of GRC by practicing like a professional, one week and one CVE at a time.
